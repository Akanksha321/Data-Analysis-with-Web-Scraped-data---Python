# Data Analysis with Web Scraped data - Python
This repository contains datasets which have been scraped from various websites for analysis. 
I have used  <b> BeautifulSoup </b> for data gathering. 
Till now following datasets have been collected -

1. <b> Zomato Pune Restaurants  </b> - Want to find out the most expensive restaurant in Pune? Or have ever wondered which is the most rated restaurant? To get answers for some of        the questions I scraped hundreds of pages of zomato pune. 

      Not from pune? You can use the scraping code to get data for your own city. 

2. <b> FMCG products from Paytm, Amazon and Flipkart </b> - This was a mini project that was worked upon as a team. 

3.  <b>  Glassdoor Employee Reviews   </b> - Maybe you are looking for changing your company and need to know how employees feel about that company? Or maybe you wonder how does           the employees of your own company feel to know better where you can improve as an organization? You can use the  code to scrap glassdoor to get data of the company of your         choice.
        This can be used for sentiment analysis, topic modelling, rating forecasting based  on reviews; the possibilities are endless.
