Pros

1. High amounts of free time - so much that u feel underutilised but its good if u wanna switch. Study and switch to companies with 2x salary and less toxicity
2. Health benefits. Leave policy. 
3. Recroom.","Cons - 
1. Recroom. I have seen people playing TT all day in rec-room and get hikes better than some people who work hard all day (includes me obviously)
2. Unfair treatment. They say they use market correction my foot. They pay differently even among teams and boast of being fair. I mean come on, isn't that funny. People who do not understand basic programming stuff get same hikes are people who do good just cuz... of manager bias or cuz manager is of opposite sex.
3.They dont follow on their words - Managers are only for the sake of approving leave. Do nothing sit all day in single place and talk big words. Leadership just talks about big terms and do nothing on it.
4. Leadership does not care about a persons career growth. U wil be treated as a resource and not a human. So much that I am planing to switch back to the company I came from. I wish I never switched to Principal global for the same of higher package - my friends at my previous org make more than me and half of them have been onsite too."

2017-04-28,Lacking technical growth & career advancement opportunities,Current Employee - Senior Software Engineer,Pune,2.0,Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,I have been working at Principal Financial Group full-time for more than 5 years,"For Pune location:
1. Good joining compensation
2. Group Insurance policy
3. Free transport (cab) facility
4. Comparatively less work pressure (due to this, most spaces are occupied by married women, mostly mothers - for years)
5. Salary received on last working day of every month.","For Pune location:
1. the way in which the performance appraisal process is carried out by management (this happens twice a year and is the period when employees are frustrated and pissed off the most)
2. no transparency in promotion policy; Managers and HR are incapable of answering the related questions and always provide fancy sounding answers to fool the employees.
3. unapproachable or non-responding Human... Resource (HR) department.
4. Lack of technical knowledge to most of the managers / leaders. If you wish to have manager's guidance in technical areas, then it is myth in Principal Pune.
5. Following the Agile principles for the namesake; actually no department has come out of waterfall mindset yet. Still they boast of Agile world. Clear Over-hyped here.
6. Middle management is not capable of taking cues from top management goals and derive business unit level goals for Pune employees. Here they are completely dependent on US based counterparts. So rest of the App developers / BAs / POs / QAs get dragged behind such copy+pasted strategy.
7. Mid management does paperwork for planning but lacks the drivers for executing the same; also it lacks managers who can lead from front to implement the plans. Due to this most of the plans have never come into existence and remained on power point slides.
8. Only 4 organizational leaves per year in addition to 30 individual leaves.
9. Cafeteria food quality can definitely be improved.
10.Career growth gets stopped after a while.
11.Favoritism is promoted a lot by managers / leaders.
12.Managers/ leaders are not aware of your work so before appraisals they try to get that knowledge from their favored employees (who can easily malign or downgrade your work).
13. Too old technologies to work upon. Other competitors and even the start-ups are providing better technologies.
14. Lack of transparent communication at most of the levels.
15. Not much motivation and time given for practical innovation."

Basically they do not have anything to offer to the people who wants to learn.
The scenario in QA is the pathetic they... hired some senior consultant  to monitor QA and  that was the decision which is going wrong against PGS.  When you hire mid management/higher management  people from Service industry they can damage  the culture of a captive unit which is happening now.

And specially Indian management is ruining the name of THE PRINCIPAL.

1) Most important you should be very good at managing and doing events. Even if you are not good at work that is fine but you should be... good at some extra activities apart from work like managing events, birthday party , games for employee, take parts in annual functions and so on.
2) You should know the development skills as well. As a QA they expect you to play a role of BA, QA and events organisation then only you will be able to survive here otherwise they will not terminate you but you will not get promotion and salary hikes.
3) As a QA you can only achieve the level of Team Leader. They will never promote a QA person to the manager level as they have adopted Agile and they wants the Scrum Master from Development back ground only. So QA people have no future over here.
4) Rating systems are pretty pathetic. They can give all the bloody reasons if they want to screw you up and you don't remain with any choices here.
5) Principal is now not paying as per the markets.

US counterparts treat PGS counterparts with... little or no respect. There may be exceptions though.
The managers are bunch of idiots who know nothing except for keeping on eye on their teams in terms of where they go, who they talk to, who is spending more time in cafeteria and the list is endless.

-People there more focused towards other people life and day to day home activities instead of work. That's really funny - Are you here for gossip it was shocking for me.
-Selection procedure is worst, they take 4 rounds of interview and select GEM, but when that GEM joins company  he will find very less quality work of his level.... Company is still growing in India even after 8 years of completion.
-According to Policy, we cant share our rating and hike which we get on annual basis..Good Rating people gets less paid and other gets better hike on the name of NORMALIZATION ?? Are you really serious ? Very Demotivating Environment.
-PGS is work under Home Office  and its clearly visible that HO people dont trust much on Indian teams. so we usually get Labor work and good work was always taken by HO Teams. - Lack of Trust to Indian Teams.
-I think Management should make environment free for youngsters - Freshers feels very suffocated in between old people of PGS -They are very narrow minded.
-History says that PGS started with 6 to 7 People and now these people became managers and seniors management in 8 years which doesn't brings quality in system instead less qualified people at higher level make system more inefficient.

Good for people who don't have great ambition in life
facilities like canteen, cab are good","Very poor management , if you are coming from one of the top IT providers, you can clearly notice how poor the management, esp senior management. They don't have any skills or talent that you can learn from. They are in political groups and support old timers.
No career growth. there are developers of 10 years experience and if you ask for growth you get answer like ""if you want you leave, we dont have anything for... you"". Management is arrogant that they can pay and get resources whenever they want. The typical life span of an employee is 2 years beyond which you will find it difficult to work in PGS.
Most of the senior employees are very poor technically and also in business area. If you are expectation is that PGS needs technical skills or great business skills, then you are wrong. All you need is  a below average brain.
Lots of unethical practice - which can't be commented here as glassdoor will anyway remove them, when I say unethical, it is really bad - even political organizations may not be that bad!!
an interesting case is that the company is surrounded by malls and movie halls, so you will have many employees going out for breaks and returning late. This includes managers."

2014-09-15,"Weak Pune Management, good for short term stay",Former Employee - Consultant,Pune,1.0,Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,I worked at Principal Financial Group full-time for more than 5 years,"Principal Global Services, the IT & ITES extension of Principal Financial Group provides excellent facilities like cab service (yes AC cabs!) and Industry average pay. Your salary will usually be around the average salary for typical captives like RBS, Wellsfargo etc. Thanks to the US office, the work load is usually never heavy, and typical of a reversal role in IT outsourcing, the US office usually works extra,... while the India office has less work. There are Pune employees who have not worked for several years. 
Work and direct interaction with US office is the highlight of being in PGS and hence there is no onsite to play work related stunts.
If you work hard, you can learn a lot and use it after you leave PGS and join other companies.","Due to captive nature of organization, there is no outward thinking and management is more on operations side - ie simple supervisory job. the senior managers in PGS don't act or work because there is not incentive for them to perform.
Promotion is in the form of IJP  and is highly controversial. There are instances of employees being promoted because they played ""Tambola"" (Bingo) and hence contributed to... organizational activities and therefore promoted! Promotion has come in the form of shooting an email to the CIO on asking how backups are taken!! 
Decisions are based on hearsay and loose talk - anyone can ""conspire"" against anyone by going to the senior management and saying that ""he/she said like this...."" and the management takes decisions on such loose talk. In fact, the concept of ""spies"" aka ""khabaris"" is common in PGS. Every manager has a gossip monger and more the filthy talk, better is the reward granted in promotions or townhall awards.
Unethical practices like personal relations being favoured in job selection and promotions. 
Learning in technology and business is strictly restricted. Even exams for certifications can't be refunded, and domain knowledge and skill building is a strict no no. There are weird reasons for not supporting knowledge like ""We don't want to build knowledge, we build relations"".
Some managers curse and use abusive language to employees and despite complaining to higher ups, things have been hushed up making a mockery of the so called employee values and ethical policies.
Birthday celebrations for the so called top management are executed in style, the most of the lazy bunch practice for a day and when the d-day arrives, what you see is songs, Mexican waves, balloons and sycophants that can put the the middle age dark world to shame.
You may be wondering what is US office doing despite knowing the razzmatazz in Pune? Perhaps, US office is the main culprit in the kind of total waste of Princial's public shareholder wealth. The cost to PGS is a hedge to the ineffective team of PGS so that US jobs are safe."

Participation in outside work (music, songs, dance, birthday songs) is considered more important than key projects.
There are too many managers who dont understand why they exist and they pretend to know more than the HO folks. The so called L3,L2 (managers) get some one or two words... from HO and then try to act as though they know it all.

Toxic work environment.  
Management was pretty clueless about how to implement the cloud strategy.  They want to move EVERYTHING to the cloud; not just that, but they want to move it to an different RDBMS system.  They want to do this without providing any kind of meaningful training; the expectation seems... to be the employees should spend their own personal time learning the cloud environment, while keeping up with their existing responsibilities.
Absolutely no appreciation for the job being done to keep the lights on while this new strategy moves forward.  
There seems to be a philosophy that about 1/3 of the employees will get below average ratings, regardless if they are doing a good job or not.  I heard from many employees who have experienced this.

If you are looking for an IT job, stay away from PGI within Principal."

So what you get is 20 people all requesting any day off... that’s available so that when a person actually needs to take time off, there is none available.

There are phenomenal benefits - some above market, some at market and perhaps even some below but I do believe that while some of the benefits don't pertain to me (updated maternity/paternity leaves, etc.), I'm still thrilled that I work for a company that is always trying to do what's best while being fiscally responsible.","No company is perfect and I've had my share of ups and downs but I recognize that companies are run by humans, and we all make mistakes. I do wish we were a little faster with change and maybe a few less levels of leaders. While it's nice for growth opportunity (if it ever becomes available), it leads to greater disparity between the front line employees and senior leaders. My current role has just three levels... between myself and the CEO and I'm not a formal leader! Make more opportunities like that (even to their BU senior leader) so people can truly see the direction we are moving and understand that strategy."

He was great.);  company provided parking ramps;  modernized downtown corporate campus all connected to downtown via skywalk system.  Principal is a successful financial services company in a medium sized city, but has a world wide footprint.  It boasts many employees who have worked... there for their entire careers. I worked there almost 20 years myself.   It is trying to attract the younger talent to position itself for the future.","This is not your father's Principal.  The small company atmosphere has given way to a generic, large company, corporate coldness. The pay is mediocre. The medical insurance is middle of the road by design. PTO has recently given way to the new open time off system that companies all seem to be adopting. PTO was considered a ""liability to the company.""  In my case, I forfeited nine days of PTO that I had remaining in... my PTO bank, but the company policy changed, so I was not entitled to that anymore. As indicated previously, I had worked for the company for twenty years ( two separate time periods separated by a short period of about one year).  I had no disciplinary issues. My performance reviews were solid. I was probably not a ""superstar,"" but I was versatile and consistent. I was always complimented for being a team player with a good attitude.  I put in overtime when needed, in order to complete time sensitive work.   My quality was 100%.  Why mention all of this? I was let go, based on missing ""performance goals,"" the last time by less than 1%.  The department had recently adopted a new work log system, and they took a hard line on performance, based on this system, which was not entirely accurate. It had to be fixed a couple of times for not correctly recording the data.  Any attempt to reason with management was met with canned responses. ( I had about six managers in a ten year period, by the way). So, even though we were having to break in a new manager every couple of years, we never got credit for keeping things together during those transitions.  There was lots of turnover in our department. The stress of this constant turmoil, coupled with minimal training, high expectations, managers constantly harping on your ""metrics,"" and the monotony of the job, sends you home feeling like you are just a cog in the machine. No sympathy from management. They have directives that must be delivered, so expect that going in. Principal is just like any other financial services company, but with a sweet wellness center.   Not for everybody. It was time to get out of ""cube city"" for me."

They will ask for your input  to feign consensus, then dismiss it out of hand.
There is a significant amount of make work, that is, more important than real work.
Conference rooms for projects are full of people around the table most have very little reason of being there, then claim they were never told about x.y.z.
Female management will... mother hen every thing.
Agree with the most absurd plan your ""leader"" presents and you are GOLDEN.
Best to just simply play dumb, and simply just not care.","The favorites are well known, as are the patsy's.
If your thoughts are dismissed management will laugh behind your back, then expect to be ""counseled"".  Strike ONE
The continual churn of the make work is embarrassing:
Project managers insist that the project fits into their personal template method.
Project managers insist on using a past projects, that are similar in name only to populate the new project. This... leaves no room for something new or different. All tasks must be accounted for. Most tasks are left N/A. Then the project team goes through each task to scrutinize each task, followed by mass confusion. STRIKE 2
Mother Hen / Queen Bee will scrutinize every word you write, every word you say.  They will guide you to go left when straight is the correct course, the project team will demand to go right even after advising of the risks. Strike 3
After some further manipulation, it is broadcast that you are not a team player.
Management decides to coach you, and now you are officially blackballed.  From that point on your management will always go all historical on you. Many are kept around as patsy's. Most simply claim they don't know anything about anything to avoid any and all possible work. Many Many others are just simply bullied, until the preference is to kill yourself.
PFG claims to be the most ethical company.
Employee class action (settled) showed that the only offered 401K investment vehicles chosen were offered by PFG which carried significantly higher fees than nearly identical index funds.  These higher fee funds have now been replaced with a percentage rate management fee, which now suggests PFG will make more money off of employees retirement accounts."

They are working on this in the claims department trying to bring up the pay to be on par with other claims departments in the area. 

If you are hired hourly you are expected to work 50 plus hours as needed.  Which ends up being all the time. So the flexibility is just in the hours you work but you will actually be working all the time. Good if you just want to make money and have no life.

Claim work is exhausting.  It has a very high burnout rate and management does not have a clue on how to fix the problem- which seems simple HIRE more people and increase retention of the employees you already have,  by treating them better!

Work schedule is sorta flexible, they don't care if you're late if it is less than 30 minutes you don't even have to call in. You can flex up to hours per week with management approval. Some people can work from home. I have almost never had a problem getting time off.

I have met Dan Houston in passing a few times. I shook his... hand and saw him at the grocery to once, and he spoke. I have never met any other CEO in a casual setting.","My direct boss is not a critical thinker. My department requires a college education for even the lowest level entry job but my manager doesn't have one. My boss is a dinosaur that doesn't know how to use our computer tools or interpret new data beyond the obvious. Honestly, the type of general incompetence that my boss displays as a manager is like none other that I have seen. I also I think this person has a bias... against black males or perhaps males in general. My boss does not remember names of guys that report to them and usually makes decisions that lean toward women when a disagreement happens even if they are obviously fundamentally wrong when compared to guidelines. 

There is not a lot of ethnic diversity and not a lot of diverse thinkers.

When I was hired I had more work experience than my peers that started at the same time and 4 year college degree. Yet fresh graduates get paid more than I do who started after me.

I think that it is possible that some of the resistance that I have felt could be because I am a minority. I am not say that my coworkers are bigots, I am just treated differently. It also doesn't help that my direct manager has been creating a negative narrative. 

I can't give the culture a high score because I am being mistreated, even though outside of my department has been a completely opposite experience.

Benefits are not as good as Wells Fargo.

Their might have been a lot of opportunities for me but my manager has made advancement and even transferring impossible.

HR is not really responsive. They never followed up with me even via email.

I would never recommend my company or department to any black male. Outside of that I might recommend them a non minority if I got a paid referral.

6 month outlook? I am sure they'll be around but sometimes I wonder. My department percentage of the overall revenue stream is probably less than 1% overall."

Nice buildings easy access to the skywalk system.  Benefits appear to be nice but do your research Principal takes advantage of many loopholes to ensure you can't really have or use your benefits.  In the end the end, the benefits... are no better than any other insurance or financial firm in town.  Frankly benefits at other major employers in town are better.  You won't have to work very hard particularly in management because social hour is every hour if you are selected to be part of their Greek social letter. At the Principal the edge that will take you far is your unabashed flattery of management.  Principal is an easy target for another organization to acquire.","MICRO-MANAGEMENT be ready for your leader needing to read and critique every email you write.  The current management is:  If you were not capable of performing your job, but were part of the selected social order then you were considered management material and are now part of management.  Principal states that they want new ideas, this is unequivocally false, the only ideas that are to be entertained are the... social order's ideas.  The technology at principal is laughable at best, backwards hardly describes it.  The new technology is all about having more social hour meetings.  It now enables the do nothings to do nothing from home well perhaps make it easier to micro-manage the staff.  Analysis Paralysis - the best way to cope with this is to create an analysis that supports the existing status-quo or the preconceived notions of management.  If something is incorrect or wrong never ever bring any attention to it, if it runs counter to any existing practice.  Outsourcing is the future of Principal, if you work here or are thinking about working here understand and embrace that fact.  The management team is a self-serving social group,  they will talk about you behind your back, remember that when they talk about others to you.  Management will not be truthful with you, yet demonstrate a holier than though attitude, remember they are always correct and The Principal Corporation is always correct."

This is largely like owning your own financial planning practice with the corporate benefits that come for working with a large institutions.,"The comp structure is good, but it is very complex. It is unnecessarily so in my opinion. The technology, while improving, is significantly deficient when put next to large firms. The technology costs can also be a bit imposing for new employees.

The awesome benefits come at the price of pay. Work-life balance is good, you won't be asked to work long hours at this job.","This company is a mess from top to bottom.  At a superficial level things seem okay but in reality the employees are extremely spoiled with a strong sense of entitlement.  Employees expect to be 'given' everything.  For this reason it is not uncommon for coworkers to come in late, leave a couple of hours early and complain about others the rest of the time, all the while expecting the next promotion will be theirs. ... The culture of the company is only nice on the surface, scratch beneath the top layer and the people are treacherous, manipulative and untrustworthy.  On top of that many have a ""Me first"" attitude.  The egos at this place are outrageous and because of it people don't genuinely listen to what others have to say.  That is to say the culture is extremely insular.  Case in point of this a surprising number of the people I worked with were totally clueless when it came to basic business knowledge even as it pertained to finance which was surprising in a financial services company, and being woefully uninformed seemed to be totally acceptable just so long as you didn't inform anyone of that because everyone believes they can walk on water.  My guess is that the company may be doing well now but as the industry becomes more competitive the company will slip and the people that work there will only get worse.  Worse yet Principal pays below market average and try to lowball you as much as possible as a premium to get to live in Des Moines I guess.  Its hard to imagine that in the long term the company will continue to attract top talent if they even do already.  Don't expect a lot from this company!"

2013-02-15,Quality company...but not for everyone,Financial Representative,"West Des Moines, IA",3.0,NA,NA,I worked at Principal Financial Group ,"Great facility, support staff, first class environment","My personal experience was that during my recruitment, I didn't fully understand the role prior to accepting an offer - that was my responsibility. In my defense, it is truly difficult to fully understand any role without actually doing it. I based my decision on generalities rather than hard facts and I probably added some ego in the mix as well. 

With 10 years prior experience in B2B Outside Sales, I felt that... my understanding of people and general business acumen would be sufficient to allow me to be successful. I was wrong.

My hope was to develop my book of business as more of an ""assets under management"" type model with insurance as an added necessity. Slow, patient, sustainable growth built on willing referrals. My personal situation was that I could afford to be patient with the growth.  

It is said that insurance is never purchased, but always sold. I understand now... No one wants insurance. It's not an exciting product and it involves self evaluation on the clients part, which let's face it; no one loves to do. Also the strategies that were encouraged, involved obvious leading questions into how a person would feel if they didn't make it home that night etc. Not trying to place a moral judgment on this, but it just felt manipulative and unnecessary.

I guess that I much prefer a straight business proposition - this is who I am, this is why I'm here, and this is why I'm the best choice for your business solution. With insurance there is very little proprietary about your product. There's not much benefit from one provider to the next other than consumer trust in your brand."

In my personal case, management re-wrote an annual review to better serve their needs.  I brought this along with evidence in the form of e-mails and other dated and signed documents to HR, but could not get a return call.  I understand that I work in an ""at will"" state and can be let go for any reason, but was sad to see the lengths... that management went to to fabricate situations and re-write history to make their case.  That is not the way that you treat any employee, much less a top producer in your division."

However; as a legal Support Assistant you are doing everybody else’s job and get noted as the catch all for the department when others can't perform up to par, or are too lazy to do their own job that they are being paid an inflated salary for. The company runs on a seniority pay scale, so you can have an employee in your department that doesn't do... anything, but has been with the company since Jesus so they get paid outrageous amounts for their little effort.

The facilities are great and amenities are numerous.,The upward advancement is completely gone from this company and benefits or compensation are being slashed every week that people are working.
2009-06-01,"Flexible and fair, but unsatisfying",Senior Analyst,Santiago,3.0,No opinion of CEO,NA,I have been working at Principal Financial Group ,"PFG is a global company, but a great majority of its revenues come from the US. A separate company, Principal International, manages international operations.
The good side of this is that individual country divisions are allowed a lot of freedom to set policies, and that management is usually local and knows its market. This flexibility means that corporate culture is not rigid, toxic and full of internal strife,... unlike ""global bureaucracies"" like Citi.

The company regularly makes the top 100 ethical companies, and has made the ""great place to work"" list at least once or twice. The company is known to be fair and to tell its employees about what's going on. Our country division offers a lot of flexibility to part-time workers; mothers love it.

Our country division has good management. They're down-to-earth, friendly people that you can greet by their first name (or nickname) in an elevator. They have a fair idea of what they're doing, and when they don't, they have a good habit of leaving decisions to those who do know what they're doing. There's a lot of financial expertise in mid-upper management. The atmosphere is usually polite, friendly and understanding. Work hours and load are very reasonable, and as long as you do your job, no one complains if you arrive a bit late or leave a bit early.

There's some elitism: the closer you are to higher management, the better you have it. But it offers decent internal advancement opportunities if you enter in at a low level.","When I said Principal International is separate from the US companies, I meant it. Some departments have a good working relationship with US counterparts, but it doesn't amount to much.

There's no transfer program and little opportunities for advancement. Pay is mediocre; I've been offered twice my current salary by other companies 3 times during my 2-year tenure. I suppose it says something about the company in... that I didn't accept the competing job offers, but my decision had to do with false expectations. The company has a nice attitude towards married couples and working mothers, and that's great, but it offers nothing to those who aren't working mothers. There's some training courses, but they don't amount to much. The company will never pay or help you in higher studies, nor offer attractive benefits to young, unmarried people.
Working part-time is fine, but forget about stuff like working from home.

The company has a no-nonsense, down-to-earth attitude. Everyone knows what their job is and what they're expected to do. There isn't much interest in innovation. Every workplace says it's open to changing things, but those who give attention, encouragement or a budget for it are rare. Principal isn't among those rare companies.

It's not a bad company, but there's just not much to keep you in it unless you treasure the ability to keep a nice work/personal life balance. You're not going to get anywhere."

Relationship building is more important than any three things combined, if you like to talk this is a good place to work.","Working with people that have been their a long time can be difficult. Senior titled employees have a cocky sense of entitlement that can be extremely difficult to work with. Must be in a ""click"" to succeed otherwise you run the risk of being an outcast.

Twice a year there is a Town Hall style meeting with senior management to ask them questions.

Des Moines has been rated a great place to live... and to raise a family, and the cost of living is very manageable.","The division of labor is so great that roles and responsibilities can be quite limited in scope, greatly reducing the satisfaction (and amount) of day-to-day work. There is quite a bit of role overlap in the various marketing areas, leading to tension and turf battles over strategies and initiatives. The advancement of initiatives requires a HUGE amount of buy-in, almost to the point of becoming unmanageable. Senior... leadership seems to be frequently engaged in internal political issues. There is a lot of lip service paid to observing and sharing marketing best practices, but much is left to be desired in the actual application of these practices.
